# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-Ray Images

This project is focused on detecting **pneumonia from chest X-ray images** using **deep learning**. The model automatically classifies X-ray scans as **Normal** or **Pneumonia**, helping in faster and more accurate diagnosis.

### 🔹 What I Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, OpenCV
* **Model Architectures:** VGG16, ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)
* **Dataset:** Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) – [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

### 🔹 Key Steps

* Data preprocessing and augmentation
* Transfer learning using VGG16 and ResNet50
* Model training and evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
* Visualization of training metrics and confusion matrix

### 🔹 Results

* **VGG16 Model Accuracy:** ~95%
* **ResNet50 Model Accuracy:** ~93%

### 🔹 Tools Used

* **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
